## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify you have:

- Basic Markdown knowledge
- GitHub account for deployment
- AI provider API key (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI)
- Text editor (VS Code, Cursor, or similar)
- Command line comfort

## What you will build

A professional portfolio site featuring:

- About page with your technical writing background
- Documentation samples covering multiple types:
  - API reference documentation
  - Getting started guides
  - Step-by-step tutorials
  - How-to guides
  - Conceptual explanations
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - CLI tool documentation
- Case study format explaining your approach to each sample
