## Key Takeaways

### What Makes Good Output

✅ **Accurate categorization** - Features are truly new, enhancements improve existing
✅ **Appropriate exclusions** - No internal changes, test updates, or WIP commits  
✅ **Clear language** - User benefits described, not implementation details
✅ **Consistent format** - Easy to scan and read
✅ **Helpful context** - Vague commit messages clarified

### What Needs Improvement

❌ **Mixed categories** - Same type of change categorized differently
❌ **Internal content** - CI/CD, tests, or tooling changes included
❌ **Unclear value** - No context on why change matters
❌ **Too technical** - Implementation details obscuring user benefit
❌ **Missing items** - User-facing changes accidentally excluded

### Remember

The automation generates a **draft**, not a final product. Always:

1. Review categorization accuracy
2. Add business context where needed
3. Remove anything that slipped through filters
4. Adjust language for your audience
5. Add links to related documentation

**Time investment:** 10-15 minutes of review vs 90+ minutes of manual curation
