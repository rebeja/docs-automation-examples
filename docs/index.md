# Documentation Automation Examples

## Overview

This repository provides practical examples for technical writers exploring AI-assisted documentation automation. Each project demonstrates a different automation approach with complete tutorials and working examples.

## Available Projects

### Release Notes Automation

Automate release notes creation from GitHub commits using AI categorization.

**What it does:**

- Fetches commits from GitHub API
- Filters out internal/WIP changes
- Categorizes into Features, Enhancements, Bug Fixes, Documentation
- Generates formatted Markdown drafts

**Best for:**

- Technical writers in docs-as-code environments
- Teams using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
- Anyone releasing software regularly

### Doc Site Portfolio

Build a professional technical writing portfolio site with AI assistance.

**What it does:**

- Provides MkDocs template for portfolio sites
- Guides you through content generation with AI
- Helps refine and improve writing quality
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

**Best for:**

- Technical writers building portfolios
- Writers showcasing documentation projects
- Anyone creating a professional web presence

## What You'll Learn

Both projects teach fundamental automation skills:

1. **Process documentation** - How to document workflows before automating
2. **Prompt engineering** - How to teach AI your standards
3. **Iterative refinement** - How to improve automation based on results
4. **API integration** - How to connect tools and services
5. **Plan-before-code** - Why planning saves time over jumping straight to implementation

## Key Principles

These projects demonstrate important automation principles:

### Document Your Process First

Before automating anything, write down your manual workflow. Your documented process becomes the foundation for your automation.

### Plan Before Code

Ask AI to write a plan first, then implement. Plans are faster to iterate than code.

### Human-in-the-Loop

Automation generates drafts. Humans provide final review and context. This maintains quality while saving time.

### Iterate Based on Results

Your first prompt won't be perfect. Test, refine, and improve based on real outputs.
