# Documentation automation examples

Practical examples for technical writers exploring AI-assisted documentation automation. Each project demonstrates a different automation approach with complete tutorials and working examples.

## Available projects

### Release notes automation

Automate release notes creation from GitHub commits using AI categorization.

- Fetches commits from GitHub API
- Filters out internal or WIP changes
- Categorizes into Features, Enhancements, Bug Fixes, Documentation
- Generates formatted Markdown drafts

Best for technical writers in docs-as-code environments, teams using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and anyone releasing software regularly.

### Doc site portfolio

Build a professional technical writing portfolio site with AI assistance.

- Provides MkDocs template for portfolio sites
- Guides you through content generation with AI
- Helps refine and improve writing quality
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

Best for technical writers building portfolios, writers showcasing documentation projects, and anyone creating a professional web presence.

## Learn these skills

Both projects teach fundamental automation skills:

1. **Process documentation** - Document workflows before automating
2. **Prompt engineering** - Teach AI your standards
3. **Iterative refinement** - Improve automation based on results
4. **API integration** - Connect tools and services
5. **Plan-before-code** - Plan first, saving time over jumping straight to implementation

## Apply these principles

These projects demonstrate important automation principles:

### Document your process first

Write down your manual workflow before automating anything. Your documented process becomes the foundation for your automation.

### Plan before code

Ask AI to write a plan first, then implement. Plans are faster to iterate than code.

### Keep humans in the loop

Automation generates drafts. Humans provide final review and context. This maintains quality while saving time.

### Iterate based on results

Your first prompt will not be perfect. Test, refine, and improve based on real outputs.
