## Key takeaways

### What makes good output

Accurate categorization - Features are truly new, enhancements improve existing
Appropriate exclusions - No internal changes, test updates, or WIP commits  
Clear language - User benefits described, not implementation details
Consistent format - Easy to scan and read
Helpful context - Vague commit messages clarified

### What needs improvement

Mixed categories - Same type of change categorized differently
Internal content - CI or CD, tests, or tooling changes included
Unclear value - No context on why change matters
Too technical - Implementation details obscuring user benefit
Missing items - User-facing changes accidentally excluded

### Remember

The automation generates a draft, not a final product. Always:

1. Review categorization accuracy
2. Add business context where needed
3. Remove anything that slipped through filters
4. Adjust language for your audience
5. Add links to related documentation

Time investment: 10-15 minutes of review versus 90+ minutes of manual curation
