# Tutorial Overview

This step-by-step tutorial guides you through building your first release notes automation using AI coding agents.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- A working release notes automation script
- Your documented manual process
- Customized AI categorization prompts
- Ability to iterate and improve the automation
- Understanding of the pattern for future automations

## Tutorial Structure

### 1. [Setup Environment](step-1-setup.md)
**Time: 15 minutes**

Install dependencies, create configuration files, and verify everything works.

**What you'll do:**

- Install Python and dependencies
- Set up API keys
- Run your first test

### 2. [Document Your Process](step-2-document-process.md)
**Time: 30 minutes**

Write down your current manual release notes workflow. This is the most important step.

**What you'll do:**

- Complete the workflow worksheet
- Define your categorization standards
- Identify exclusion rules
- Document output format

**Why this matters:** Your documented process becomes the foundation for your automation prompt.

### 3. [Configure APIs](step-3-configure.md)
**Time: 10 minutes**

Set up GitHub and AI provider API access.

**What you'll do:**

- Create GitHub token
- Get AI API key
- Test API connections
- Understand security best practices

### 4. [First Run](step-4-run-first-time.md)
**Time: 20 minutes**

Generate your first automated release notes and review results.

**What you'll do:**

- Run with sample data
- Run with real repository
- Review output quality
- Identify improvements needed

### 5. [Iterate Prompts](step-5-iterate-prompts.md)
**Time: 30-45 minutes**

Refine your categorization prompts based on results.

**What you'll do:**

- Analyze categorization errors
- Update prompt with specific standards
- Test improvements
- Learn prompt engineering patterns

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

- Completed [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide
- Environment set up and tested
- API keys configured
- 30-60 minutes of focused time

### What You'll Need

- Your text editor open
- Terminal/command line ready
- Example repository in mind (or use provided samples)
- Patience for iteration (first attempts won't be perfect)

## Learning Approach

This tutorial follows the **plan-before-code** principle.

### Plan First, Code Second

In each step, we'll discuss the approach before implementing. This mirrors how you should work with AI coding agents—ask for a plan first, then implement.

### How to Use This Tutorial

**Option 1: Follow Exactly (Recommended for beginners)**

Work through each step in order, completing all exercises.

**Option 2: Adapt As You Go (For experienced users)**

Read through, adapt examples to your environment, skip what you already know.

**Option 3: Reference Guide**

Jump to specific sections as needed when building your own automation.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. Check [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions
2. Review [FAQ](../faq.md) - Frequently asked questions
3. Read [Examples](../examples/prompt-evolution.md) - See how others solved similar problems
4. Ask your AI coding tool - If using Cursor/Claude, ask it to explain errors

## Expected Outcomes

### By the End of Step 2
You'll have a documented manual process—the foundation for automation.

### By the End of Step 4
You'll have generated your first automated release notes draft.

### By the End of Step 5
You'll have refined prompts producing high-quality categorization.

## What Comes After

Once you complete this tutorial:

- Apply to your workflow - Integrate into your release process
- Build confidence - Try with different repositories
- Explore variations - Adapt for different audiences (internal vs external)
- Share learnings - Help others in the technical writing community

## Time Investment

**Total time:** 2-3 hours for complete tutorial

- Initial setup: 30 minutes
- Document process: 30 minutes
- First runs: 30 minutes
- Prompt iteration: 1-2 hours

This tutorial demonstrates an automation pattern that can save 4-8 hours per release cycle.
