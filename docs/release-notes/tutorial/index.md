# Tutorial overview

Build your first release notes automation using AI coding agents. This tutorial shows you how to automate release notes generation from GitHub commits.

## Build these components

- Working release notes automation script
- Documented manual process
- Customized AI categorization prompts
- Iteration and improvement workflow
- Reusable pattern for future automations

## Follow these steps

### 1. [Setup environment](step-1-setup.md)
**Time: 15 minutes**

Install dependencies, create configuration files, and verify everything works.

- Install Python and dependencies
- Set up API keys
- Run your first test

### 2. [Document your process](step-2-document-process.md)
**Time: 30 minutes**

Write down your current manual release notes workflow. This is the most important step.

- Complete the workflow worksheet
- Define your categorization standards
- Identify exclusion rules
- Document output format

Your documented process becomes the foundation for your automation prompt.

### 3. [Configure APIs](step-3-configure.md)
**Time: 10 minutes**

Set up GitHub and AI provider API access.

- Create GitHub token
- Get AI API key
- Test API connections
- Review security best practices

### 4. [First run](step-4-run-first-time.md)
**Time: 20 minutes**

Generate your first automated release notes and review results.

- Run with sample data
- Run with real repository
- Review output quality
- Identify improvements needed

### 5. [Iterate prompts](step-5-iterate-prompts.md)
**Time: 30-45 minutes**

Refine your categorization prompts based on results.

- Analyze categorization errors
- Update prompt with specific standards
- Test improvements
- Learn prompt engineering patterns

## Prerequisites

Complete the [Getting started](../getting-started.md) guide before starting this tutorial.

- Environment set up and tested
- API keys configured
- 30-60 minutes of focused time
- Text editor open
- Terminal or command line ready
- Example repository in mind (or use provided samples)

## Approach

This tutorial follows the **plan-before-code** principle. Each step discusses the approach before implementing, mirroring how you work with AI coding agents—ask for a plan first, then implement.

### Use this tutorial

**Option 1: Follow exactly (recommended for beginners)**

Work through each step in order, completing all exercises.

**Option 2: Adapt as you go (for experienced users)**

Read through, adapt examples to your environment, skip what you already know.

**Option 3: Reference guide**

Jump to specific sections when building your own automation.

2. [FAQ](../faq.md) - Frequently asked questions
3. [Examples](../examples/prompt-evolution.md) - How others solved similar problems
4. Your AI coding tool - Ask it to explain errors

## Outcomes

**After Step 2:** Documented manual process—the foundation for automation

**After Step 4:** First automated release notes draft generated

**After Step 5:** Refined prompts producing high-quality categorization

## Continue your work

After this tutorial:

- Integrate into your release process
- Try with different repositories
- Adapt for different audiences (internal versus external)
- Help others in the technical writing community

## Time required

**Total time:** 2-3 hours

- Initial setup: 30 minutes
- Document process: 30 minutes
- First runs: 30 minutes
- Prompt iteration: 1-2 hours

This automation pattern can save 4-8 hours per release cycle.
